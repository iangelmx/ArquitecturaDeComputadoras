Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of 126,800    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         40 out of  63,400    1%
    Number used as logic:                       40 out of  63,400    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              29
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   11
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  19,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           40
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            40 out of      40  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      40    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      40    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 126,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Number of errors   :   3
Number of warnings :   8

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:866 - Not enough valid sites to place the following IOBs:
   IO Standard: Name = LVCMOS18, VREF = NR, VCCO = 1.80, TERM = NONE, DIR =
   INPUT, DRIVE_STR = NR
   	A<4>
   	A<5>

   	B<11>
   	B<12>
   	B<13>
   	B<14>
   	B<15>

   This may be due to either an insufficient number of sites available on the
   device, too many prohibited sites,
   or incompatible I/O Standards locked or range constrained to I/O Banks with
   valid sites.
       This situation could possibly be resolved by one (or all) of the
   following actions:
   a) Grouping IOBs of similar standards into a minimum amount of I/O Banks by
   using LOC or range constraints.
   b) Maximizing available I/O Banks resources for special IOBs by choosing
   lower capacity I/O Banks if possible.
   c) If applicable, decreasing the number of user prohibited sites or using a
   larger device.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 56 IOs, 20 are locked
   and 36 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.
