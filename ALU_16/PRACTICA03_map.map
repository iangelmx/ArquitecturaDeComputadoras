INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 56 IOs, 20 are locked
   and 36 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.

   This may be due to either an insufficient number of sites available on the
   device, too many prohibited sites,
   or incompatible I/O Standards locked or range constrained to I/O Banks with
   valid sites.
       This situation could possibly be resolved by one (or all) of the
   following actions:
   a) Grouping IOBs of similar standards into a minimum amount of I/O Banks by
   using LOC or range constraints.
   b) Maximizing available I/O Banks resources for special IOBs by choosing
   lower capacity I/O Banks if possible.
   c) If applicable, decreasing the number of user prohibited sites or using a
   larger device.
